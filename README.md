## Project Overview

This project tackles two key challenges faced by businesses:

* **Customer Churn Prediction:**  Identify customers likely to churn using an XGBoost model based on their past purchase behavior and additional features.
* **Demand Forecasting:**  Predict the demand for products using the Prophet time series forecasting model. This helps with inventory management and resource allocation.

## Data

The project uses the following data:

* `data_cleaned.csv`: The cleaned and preprocessed sales data, including information about customer transactions (IDs, dates, amounts, products purchased, etc.).

## Models and Analyses

* **Churn Prediction:**
    * **Model:** XGBoost classifier.
    * **Features:** Total orders, average order value, recency, frequency, change in purchase frequency, etc.
    * **Evaluation:**  Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, SHAP values for interpretability.

* **Demand Forecasting:**
    * **Model:** Facebook Prophet.
    * **Features:** Date, quantity sold.
    * **Optional:** External regressors like promotions, holidays, or other factors influencing demand.
    * **Evaluation:** MAE, MAPE, RMSE, visual inspection, backtesting.

## Results and Insights (Summarize your key findings here)

* Briefly describe the most significant insights you gained from your churn prediction and demand forecasting models.
* Highlight any patterns, trends, or surprises that you discovered.
* Mention how these insights can be used to improve business decisions.

## Usage

1. **Install Requirements:** `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost prophet lifetimes plotly ipywidgets`
2. **Data Preparation:** Ensure your data is in a similar format to `data_cleaned.csv`.
3. **Run the Notebooks:**
    * Execute `churn_prediction.ipynb` to train and evaluate the churn prediction model.
    * Execute `demand_forecasting.ipynb` to generate demand forecasts for different products.
4. **Explore Results:**
    * Examine the visualizations generated by each model.
    * Analyze the evaluation metrics to understand model performance.
    * Use the SHAP plots to interpret feature importance in the churn model.

## Limitations and Future Work

* **Data Limitations:**  List any limitations in your data (e.g., missing values, limited time range) that might affect the accuracy of your models.
* **Model Assumptions:** Briefly discuss the assumptions made by the Prophet and XGBoost models.
* **Potential Improvements:** Suggest areas for future work, such as:
    * Incorporating additional features.
    * Exploring different model architectures.
    * Integrating the models with other systems or dashboards.
